Plants are increasingly vulnerable to environmental stressors—such as pathogen infection, drought, and heat—from climate change. These challenges reduce crop yields and threaten global food security. Our research goal is to sustainably enhance crop productivity and resilience through protein engineering.

<br>
### What we do
<br>
<br>
We begin with a specific need and identify key protein targets to address it. We engineer proteins using directed evolution – a synthetic biology approach that enables rapid development of protein variants with novel or enhanced functions. This approach allows us to 1) identify beneficial changes to crop proteins that can be introduced via gene editing and 2) generate large datasets to train machine learning models that can predict the function of additional protein variants.

### We focus on 
<br>
<br>
* Resistance to pathogens and pests
* Resilience to environmental stress 
* Photosynthetic efficiency
