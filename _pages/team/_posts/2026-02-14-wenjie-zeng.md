Wenjie received a Ph.D. from CEMPS in Shanghai, where her research focused on epigenetic regulation of disease resistance and gene editing in plants. She then completed one year of postdoctoral training at UCSF, developing fluorescent protein-based reporters to detect protein interactions. She is interested in developing engineered protein and genetic tools for plant synthetic biology. In her free time, she enjoys hiking and baking.
