Pilita was born and raised in the Philippines. She earned a B.S. in Foreign Service major and served most of her professional life at the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs. In 2005, she made the life-changing decision to move to the United States, where she briefly engaged with various startup companies and eventually stayed at Stanford University. The most fulfilling and cherished part of her life was when she was a full-time stay-at-home mom.
