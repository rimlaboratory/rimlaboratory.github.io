Peter (class of '29) is passionate about the application of chemical and biological engineering to diverse global issues. Having previously worked with Drosophila in Seung Kim's lab, he is excited to work with a new set of genomes from a totally different phylogenetic kingdom. Peter also enjoys community service, spending time outdoors, and making music with family and friends.
